                                Detroit, the largest city in the state of Michigan, lies on the northwest bank of the Detroit River and on Lake St Clair, between Lakes Huron and Erie.The city has long been regarded as the "metropolis of the automobile". It is the country's busiest inland port and is accessible, since the construction of the St Lawrence Seaway, to ocean-going vessels of up to 25,000 tons.

                                The city of Windsor is big enough to provide plenty of art, music, delicious food and natural beauty, but small and safe enough to make you feel instantly at home.Essex and Pelee Island as a remarkable destination for tourist, convention goers and business travellers.

                                Detroit is home to the Big Three automobile companies. As a result, Windsor is home to the Chrysler Canada Headquarters and car plants for two of the "Big Three". While the inner city of Detroit has experienced economic difficulties over the years, the affluent suburbs are magnets for immigrants, wealth, and population growth. Windsor's economy is reliant on the automotive industry, but has diversified. As an example, Caesars Windsor casino, the largest in Canada, attracts visitors from the Metro Detroit region.
